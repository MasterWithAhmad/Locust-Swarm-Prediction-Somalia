# Locust-Swarm-Prediction-Somalia
This repository contains a machine learning-based framework for predicting and mitigating locust swarms in Somalia. The project leverages publicly available environmental data (e.g., rainfall, temperature, vegetation indices) to develop lightweight and interpretable models tailored for resource-constrained regions.
